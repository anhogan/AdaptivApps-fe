    REACT_APP_WS_URL=websocket endpoint

# Testing

We used Jest beacuse it has everything we need to unit test our application

# Installation Instructions

Yarn install -> NOT npm install (several packages install dependencies and yarn installs all those project dependencies while npm will not)
npm run start

If a terminal error occurs around `babel-jest`, delete the following folders:

- node_modules
- package-lock.json
- yarn.lock

Remove `babel-jest` from package.json and run `yarn install`
